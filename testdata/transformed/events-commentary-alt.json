It's great to have 500 runs on the board. Hopefully the pitch starts to deteriorate tomorrow and we can make those 20 chances. It is starting to show some signs of inconsistency, and the more the quicks bowl there will be footmarks. At times we saw reverse swing throughout and a bit of inconsistency late in the day. Pakistan has definitely lived up to everything we wanted and more. We're having a great time. We just want to get some points on the board and win a game.\""

One less wicket lost would have Australia firmly on top, whilst 100/3 would have been a poor result after they won the toss and elected to bat first. The rough and abrasive centre wicket killed any sideways movement in the ball after about five overs, in which the opening pair of Warner and Khawaja saw through a tricky opening spell from Shaheen Shah Afridi."

It was why, at the start of this match, we were in the minority to applaud the bold decision to retain Starc's pace ahead of Hazlewood's accuracy.

The largest partnership of Pakistan's first innings was their last - 30 runs between Nauman Ali and Shaheen Shah Afridi who batted freely and with nothing to lose - but it was little more than a pain in the backside for Cummins as Lyon and Swepson got a few overs in each. Swepson was admirable on debut but played second fiddle to the quicks in the end."
