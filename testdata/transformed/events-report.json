      "CONTENT": "[b]Italy have been crowned European champions for a second time, ending a 53-year wait for glory in the European Championships, and claiming their second trophy in just 15 years after a penalty shootout victory over England at Wembley Stadium.[/b][br][br]England began strongly against an Italy side unbeaten in 33 games before kick-off, and their first chance came from a misplaced backpass, which resulted in an Italy corner. It came to nothing, and on the break Luke Shaw found Kieran Trippier via Harry Kane on the opposite wing. Italy’s defence went to press him, but paid dearly with Trippier finding Shaw at the far post, to volley low into the net with Gianluigi Donnarumma stranded.[br][br]Thereafter, the hosts dominated vast swathes of the first-half without creating much, whilst Italy were reduced to fleeting half-chances and ‘tactical’ fouls as they became increasingly frustrated. Undoubtedly reflecting on a few home truths, Italy began the second half on top. After Raheem Sterling’s penalty claims were waved away in the early minutes after the restart, Italy ventured down the other end, winning a free kick from a foul inside the England ‘D’. Lorenzo Insigne stepped up, but sent a bullet shot into a jeering crowd.[br][br]However, it proved to be but a reprieve, as England increasingly sat back. They ultimately paid the price in the 66th minute as an Insigne corner was met by Marco Verratti before the ball deflected to Leonardo Bonucci, who smashed the ball into the England goal from close range to break the home crowd’s hearts.[br][br]Domenico Berardi came close to adding a second for Italy in the 73rd minute, after an exquisite ball over the top of a shell-shocked England defence, only to fire over the bar to keep England in with a hope of ending their long trophy drought. Clear chances were sporadic in the final 15 minutes of play, leading to 30 minutes of agonising added time for both sides.[br][br]Understandably, neither of the exhausted finalists created much in the way of chances during extra time, and the overriding feeling was that only one goal would be required. However, said goal never came despite continued Italian pressure, taking the game to penalties. After nine penalties, the shootout scoreline was 3-2 in Italy's favour, and the final kick was taken by Bukayo Saka, who missed the crucial spot-kick to settle a truly unbelievable Euro 2020 showdown.[br][br][b]FlashScore Man of the Match: Leonardo Bonucci (Italy)[/b]",
